## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites

```

## 🚀 Usage

### List Files Shared with You
View all files that have been shared with your account:
```sh
filezap list
```

### Send a File Over Network
Start a file sharing server to send a file to another device on your network:
```sh
filezap send /path/to/file.txt
```
This will display:
- A **QR code** for quick mobile access
- A **URL** for browser download
- A **command-line instruction** for filezap users

### Receive a File
Connect to a file sharing server to receive a file:
```sh
filezap receive <ip> <port> <filename>
```
Example:
```sh
filezap receive 192.168.1.5 49152 presentation.pptx
```

## 📱 Mobile Device Support
filezap makes sharing with mobile devices simple:
1. On your computer, run:
   ```sh
   filezap send /path/to/file
   ```
2. On your mobile device:
   - **Option 1:** Scan the **QR code** with your camera app
   - **Option 2:** Open the **browser URL** displayed in the console
   - **Option 3:** Use alternative **IP addresses** if the primary one doesn't work

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Multiple Network Adapters
If you have multiple network adapters (VPN, virtual machines, etc.), filezap will prioritize common WiFi/Ethernet adapters and show alternatives.

### Connection Issues
If devices can't connect:
- Ensure both devices are on the **same network**
- Try **alternative IP addresses** shown in the console
- Check if **firewalls** are blocking the connection

### Firewall Configuration
On **Windows**, allow Node.js through your firewall or run:
```sh
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "filezap File Sharing" -Direction Inbound -Protocol TCP -LocalPort 3000-65000 -Action Allow
```
